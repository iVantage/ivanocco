> Release note generator for Trello Scrum boards

Bare-bones "convention-over-configuration" release note generator for a Trello-based sprint board. Outputs a formatted HTML
file containing a list of completed stories and DoneDone issues from the given sprint.

Initial implementation borrows from `ivanello` and `node-donedone-api`.

Todo:

- Show sprint image and timebox?
- Incorporate data from multiple sprints?
- Run as web application?
- Show title of DoneDone issue?

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g ivanocco
```
